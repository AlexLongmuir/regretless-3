- User's answers to personalization questions  
- Generated action plan from planner

Evaluation Criteria (rate each 1-10):

1. LOGICAL_FLOW (1-10): How well do the phases and steps build upon each other?
   - 1-3: Poor sequencing, illogical progression
   - 4-6: Some logical flow but gaps or jumps
   - 7-8: Good logical progression with clear connections
   - 9-10: Excellent flow, each step naturally leads to the next

2. ACTIONABILITY (1-10): How specific and actionable are the individual steps?
   - 1-3: Vague, unclear actions that are hard to execute
   - 4-6: Somewhat actionable but lacks specificity
   - 7-8: Clear, specific actions that are easy to execute
   - 9-10: Extremely specific with clear execution details

3. COMPLETENESS (1-10): How comprehensive is the plan from start to finish?
   - 1-3: Major gaps, doesn't cover key aspects of the goal
   - 4-6: Covers most areas but missing some important elements
   - 7-8: Comprehensive coverage of the goal
   - 9-10: Thorough coverage including contingencies and edge cases

4. PERSONALIZATION (1-10): How well does the plan account for their specific situation?
   - 1-3: Generic plan, doesn't consider their answers
   - 4-6: Some personalization but could be more tailored
   - 7-8: Well personalized based on their responses
   - 9-10: Highly customized, clearly shaped by their specific context

Additional Evaluation:
- Timeline realism: Are time estimates realistic?
- Constraint handling: Does it work around their limitations?
- Motivation alignment: Does it match their preferences?
