# Dreams Database Schema Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the Supabase database schema for the Regretless Dreams app (MVP v1). The schema enables users to set up dreams, break them into areas → actions, complete occurrences with photo evidence/notes, and track today, overdue, and streaks—all with strong tenant isolation.

## Core Tables

## Triggers

### handle_occurrence_complete
Auto-create next repeating occurrence when one is completed.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION handle_occurrence_complete()
RETURNS trigger
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
DECLARE
  action_record actions%ROWTYPE;
  next_due_date date;
  dream_end_date date;
  next_occurrence_no integer;
BEGIN
  -- Only process if this is a new completion
  IF NEW.completed_at IS NOT NULL AND (OLD.completed_at IS NULL OR OLD.completed_at IS DISTINCT FROM NEW.completed_at) THEN
    -- Get the action details
    SELECT * INTO action_record 
    FROM actions 
    WHERE id = NEW.action_id AND is_active = true AND deleted_at IS NULL;
    
    -- Only create next occurrence if action has repeat_every_days set
    IF action_record.repeat_every_days IS NOT NULL THEN

## Utility Functions

### soft_delete_area(area_id)
Atomically soft-delete an area and all its actions.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.soft_delete_area(p_area_id uuid)
RETURNS void
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY INVOKER
AS $$
BEGIN
  -- mark area deleted (respecting RLS via auth.uid())
  UPDATE public.areas
     SET deleted_at = NOW()
   WHERE id = p_area_id
     AND user_id = auth.uid()
     AND deleted_at IS NULL;

  -- cascade soft-delete actions in that area
  UPDATE public.actions a
     SET deleted_at = NOW()
   WHERE a.area_id = p_area_id
     AND a.user_id = auth.uid()
     AND a.deleted_at IS NULL;
END
$$;

### create_occurrence_series(p_action_id)
Create a series of occurrences for finite-slice actions.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.create_occurrence_series(p_action_id uuid)
RETURNS integer
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY INVOKER
AS $$
DECLARE
  v_action record;
  i int;
BEGIN
  SELECT * INTO v_action
  FROM public.actions
  WHERE id = p_action_id;

  IF v_action.slice_count_target IS NULL THEN
    RETURN 0;
  END IF;

  IF v_action.user_id <> auth.uid() THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'not owner';
  END IF;

  FOR i IN 1..v_action.slice_count_target LOOP
    INSERT INTO public.action_occurrences(
      action_id, user_id, dream_id, area_id,
      occurrence_no, planned_due_on, due_on, defer_count, note
    )
    VALUES (
      v_action.id, v_action.user_id, v_action.dream_id, v_action.area_id,
      i, NULL, NULL, 0, NULL
    )
    ON CONFLICT (action_id, occurrence_no) DO NOTHING;
  END LOOP;

  RETURN v_action.slice_count_target;
END
$$;
```

## Security & Permissions

### View Security Configuration
All views are configured with `security_invoker = on` to ensure they respect RLS policies and run with the permissions of the calling user, not the view creator.

### Permission Grants
The following permissions are configured for the `authenticated` role:

**Views (SELECT only):**
- `v_action_occurrence_status`
- `v_active_actions` 
- `v_active_areas`
- `v_dream_daily_summary`
- `v_overdue_counts`

**Tables (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE):**
- `dreams`
- `areas`
- `actions`
- `action_occurrences`
- `action_artifacts`
- `profiles`
- `ai_events`
- `notification_preferences`

**Functions (EXECUTE):**
- `defer_occurrence(uuid)`
- `current_streak(uuid, uuid)`
- `soft_delete_area(uuid)`
- `create_occurrence_series(uuid)`

**Schema Access:**
- `USAGE` on `public` schema
- `CREATE` on `public` schema (for temporary tables)

The `anon` role has all permissions revoked on these objects, ensuring only authenticated users can access data.

### API Integration
All API routes now use the `supabaseServerAuth(userToken)` function instead of the service role client. This ensures:
- RLS policies are enforced automatically
- Users can only access their own data
- No manual user ownership checks are needed in API code
- Better security through principle of least privilege

## Row Level Security (RLS)

All tables have RLS enabled with policies ensuring users can only access their own data:

```sql
-- Enable RLS on all tables
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE dreams ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE areas ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE actions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE action_occurrences ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE action_artifacts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE ai_events ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE notification_preferences ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Force RLS (prevents bypassing policies)
ALTER TABLE profiles FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE dreams FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE areas FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE actions FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE action_occurrences FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE action_artifacts FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE ai_events FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE notification_preferences FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Profiles policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can access own profile" ON profiles
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Dreams policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can access own dreams" ON dreams
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Areas policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can access areas for their dreams" ON areas
  FOR ALL USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM dreams 
      WHERE dreams.id = areas.dream_id 
      AND dreams.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Actions policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can access actions for their dreams" ON actions
  FOR ALL USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM areas a
      JOIN dreams d ON d.id = a.dream_id
      WHERE a.id = actions.area_id 
      AND d.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Action occurrences policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can access occurrences for their dreams" ON action_occurrences
  FOR ALL USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM actions act
      JOIN areas a ON a.id = act.area_id
      JOIN dreams d ON d.id = a.dream_id
      WHERE act.id = action_occurrences.action_id 
      AND d.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Action artifacts policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can access artifacts for their dreams" ON action_artifacts
  FOR ALL USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM action_occurrences ao
      JOIN actions act ON act.id = ao.action_id
      JOIN areas a ON a.id = act.area_id
      JOIN dreams d ON d.id = a.dream_id
      WHERE ao.id = action_artifacts.occurrence_id 
      AND d.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- AI events policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can read own ai_events" ON ai_events
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own ai_events" ON ai_events
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Notification preferences policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can access own notification preferences" ON notification_preferences
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

## Storage Policies

### Storage Bucket Configuration
```sql
-- Create artifacts bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
VALUES ('artifacts', 'artifacts', false);

-- Storage policies for artifacts
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload artifacts for their occurrences" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'artifacts' 
    AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM action_occurrences ao
      JOIN actions act ON act.id = ao.action_id
      JOIN areas a ON a.id = act.area_id
      JOIN dreams d ON d.id = a.dream_id
      WHERE ao.id::text = (storage.foldername(name))[2]
      AND d.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can view artifacts for their occurrences" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (
    bucket_id = 'artifacts' 
    AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete artifacts for their occurrences" ON storage.objects
  FOR DELETE USING (
    bucket_id = 'artifacts' 
    AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );
```

## Key Behaviors

### Repeat Logic
When an occurrence is completed and the action has `repeat_every_days` set:
1. Calculate next due date: `planned_due_on + repeat_every_days`
2. Check if next date exceeds dream `end_date` (if set)
3. If not, auto-insert new occurrence with same `planned_due_on` and `due_on`

### Defer Logic
When deferring an occurrence:
1. Increment `due_on` by 1 day
2. Increment `defer_count` by 1
3. Keep `planned_due_on` unchanged for analytics

### Overdue Detection
An occurrence is overdue when:
- `completed_at IS NULL` AND `due_on < CURRENT_DATE`

### Streak Calculation
Current streak for a dream:
1. Start from today and count backwards
2. For each day, check if there's ≥1 completed occurrence
3. Stop counting when a day has no completions

## JSON Schema Examples

### acceptance_criteria (in actions table)
```json
[
  "Complete 30 minutes of focused practice",
  "Record progress in practice journal",
  "Identify one area for improvement"
]
```

### metadata (in action_artifacts table)
```json
{
  "camera_info": {
    "make": "Apple",
    "model": "iPhone 14",
    "lens": "Wide"
  },
  "location": {
    "latitude": 37.7749,
    "longitude": -122.4194,
    "accuracy": 10
  },
  "tags": ["progress", "milestone", "before"]
}
```

## Common Queries
